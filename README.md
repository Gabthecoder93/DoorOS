# DoorOS

**Because every closed Window needs an open Door.**

A private, lightweight desktop experience  
running as a single executable.

---

## Overview

DoorOS is a minimal desktop environment that runs **on top of Windows**  
and behaves like a standalone operating system.

It launches in full screen, captures all its windows internally,  
and provides a complete desktop experience inside a single application.

No installation.  
No background processes.  
One executable.

---

## Philosophy

Modern operating systems became complex, noisy and invasive.

DoorOS goes the opposite way:
- minimal by design  
- simple by default  
- privacy-first by principle  

Your environment exists **only while you use it**.

---

## Privacy model

DoorOS follows a **zero-retention** policy.

- No tracking  
- No analytics  
- No persistent storage by default  

If a user account is inactive for **48 hours**,  
**all associated data is permanently deleted**:
- account  
- files  
- notes  
- applications  
- metadata  

Deletion is enforced **server-side** and is irreversible.

If you don’t use it, it disappears.

## Built-in applications

DoorOS includes a focused set of native apps:

- Notes  
- Calculator  
- Cloud File Explorer  
- Text Editor  
- Python IDE with execution & terminal  
- Built-in Web Browser  
- Community App Store  

All applications run **inside DoorOS**.

---

## Community App Store

Users can publish lightweight Python applications.

- Apps are `.py` files with an icon  
- Installed dynamically at runtime  
- Strict sandboxing  
- No access to user data or backend credentials  
- Dangerous imports blocked  

Experimentation without compromising security.
